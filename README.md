# Identification of spatial domains, spatially variable genes, and genetic association studies of Alzheimer disease with an autoencoder-based fuzzy clustering algorithm
Now, codes of ST cluster algorithm implemented by pytorch is available:

pytorch-1.3.1

numpy

scikit-learn

scipy

You can download the file, unzip "3000matrix.csv.zip," and run "run3.py" to obtain the spatial transcriptome clustering result. You can also obtain the reconstruction matrix.
